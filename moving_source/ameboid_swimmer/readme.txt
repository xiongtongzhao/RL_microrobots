The codes to achieve a ring swimmer's chemotaxis towards a moving source will generate two directories (traj, traj2) to store the swimmer's data. 

In the "traj" directory, all files should be concatenated sequentially according to their indexes in the file names, forming a complete dataset of the swimmer's information.
Each line corresponds to: X coordinate of centroid, Y coordinate of centroid, first link's global angle, angle at hinges

In the "traj2" directory, all files should be concatenated sequentially according to their indexes in the file names, forming a complete dataset of the swimmer's information.
Each line corresponds to: X coordinate of centroid, Y coordinate of centroid, swimmer's moving dirction, X coordinate of the swimmer's end located at first link, Y coordinate of the swimmer's end located at first link, X coordinate of source, Y coordinate of source.
