The codes to achieve a ring swimmer's chemotaxis in a constricted space will generate two directories (traj, traj2) to store the swimmer's data. 

In the "traj" directory, all files should be concatenated sequentially according to their indexes in the file names, forming a complete dataset of the swimmer's information.
Each line corresponds to: X coordinate of centroid, Y coordinate of centroid, first link's global angle, angle at hinges

In the "traj2" directory, all files should be concatenated sequentially according to their indexes in the file names, forming a complete dataset of the swimmer's information.
Each line corresponds to: X coordinate of centroid, Y coordinate of centroid, swimmer's moving dirction, maximum pressure at hinges.
